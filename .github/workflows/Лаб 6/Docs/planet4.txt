Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences in the world. The study of astronomy involves all of the objects outside Earth’s atmosphere. These include the sun, Moon, planets, stars, galaxies, and all other matter in the universe. People known as astronomers have studied these objects for thousands of years.

Most of the universe’s objects are located in galaxies. The galaxies are huge groups of stars along with gas and dust. Some galaxies contain as many as a trillion stars. The smaller galaxies may have fewer than a million stars.
The planet Earth is located in a galaxy called the Milky Way. One of the stars in that galaxy is the sun. Earth and the other planets revolve around the sun. Satellites, or moons, revolve around the planets. Smaller objects, asteroids and comets, also orbit the sun. All of these bodies make up the solar system.

Astronomers study the universe in different ways. Some are professionals, meaning that they make their living at the work. Others study objects in space as a hobby. They are known as amateur astronomers.
Some astronomers work in laboratories. There they study actual samples of objects that have been collected by spacecraft. These include meteorites, rock samples from the moon, and dust particles.
Many astronomers observe distant objects with the help of telescopes. Telescopes range in size. Some are small enough to be carried by hand. Large telescopes are often housed in buildings known as observatories. The Hubble Space Telescope is in orbit around Earth as a floating observatory. The Hubble magnifies and records images of distant space objects. It then sends the information to astronomers on Earth. Other manned and unmanned spacecraft also have gathered information about the sun, Moon, and planets.
Astronomers also use cameras and other instruments to record information about distant objects. Photographs provide astronomers with a visual record of their observations. Other instruments can help reveal faint, hard-to-detect objects in outer space. These instruments measure the light and other radiation coming from the objects.

Thousands of years ago there were no calendars or clocks. People kept track of time by watching the sun and the stars. It was important for them to know the time in order to sow their crops and reap their harvests. These people were the first astronomers.
The most influential ancient astronomer was Ptolemy of Alexandria in Egypt. He lived in the ad 100s. He developed the idea that Earth occupies the center of the universe. He thought that the other objects revolved around Earth. Most people believed this idea of Ptolemy’s for more than a thousand years.
In 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus published a revolutionary new theory. He believed that Earth and the other planets revolve around the sun. Copernicus was criticized because he challenged Ptolemy’s theory. Galileo Galilei, a great Italian scientist and astronomer, supported Copernicus’ theory with his observations.
Later astronomers made new discoveries that also supported Copernicus’ idea. In the early 1600s Johannes Kepler explained how the planets travel around the sun. In 1687 Isaac Newton learned about gravitation and motion. His work reinforced Kepler’s laws. Today astronomers know that Copernicus was correct. But there are still many questions about the universe. Astronomers continue to try to answer those questions.
