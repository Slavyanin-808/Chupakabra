The ancient Maya excelled at agriculture, pottery, hieroglyph writing, calendar-making, mathematics and were one of the most impressive astronomers in the past.
While it is known among scholars that the ancient Maya created sophisticated celestial maps and mapped the sky with extreme precision in order to calculate the length of months and years, their astronomical achievements may have been underestimated by academics.
According to a new study, this ancient Mesoamerican civilisation was so advanced that their knowledge in astronomy rivalled that applied by famous astronomer Copernicus some 700 years later.
According to findings of a leading anthropologist, he uncovered conclusive evidence that indicates ancient Maya astronomers observed the planets in our solar system over 1,000 years ago in a way that centuries later made Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.
Dr Gerardo Aldana, an anthropologist from the University of California Santa Barbara, examined with great detail the Venus Table found in the Dresden Codex and offers a new interpretation of its meaning.
Dr Aldana believes that indicate observations found in the Dresden Codex —a tenth century Ancient Maya book from Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico— may have been greatly overlooked.
Dr Aldana offers an entirely different thinking suggesting that rather than simply being ordinary numerology as many researchers have claimed, the ancient text illustrates intricate astronomical observations made from Chichen Itza.
According to Dr Aldana, this type of astronomical observation may have been developed by the Ancient Maya as early as 870 A, hundreds of years before famous astronomer Copernicus came up with the idea that our sun was located at the centre of our solar system in the early 16th century.
Speaking about his discovery Dr Aldana suggests:
