Articles related to mothers and motherhood from some of the world’s top child and family researchers.
Research on mothers, mothering and motherhood typically explores the impact of mothers’ behaviours on their children, and factors that affect mothers and the quality of their parenting. Motherhood is one of the most established and developed areas of researcMother’s Day is on the horizon (May 13th, if you need an extra reminder) and sometimes, the best way to honor your mom is through a quote. And if that quote happens to involve food, even better.
If you think about it, Mother’s Day and food have a lot in common. It’s a day where mom shouldn’t be cooking for the family — instead, she should be feasting on croissants and fruit salad and brunch mimosas while putting her feet up and relaxing (for once!) Since so many people use food as a sign of love, Mother’s Day should be all about good food. Being a mom is hard work, and it’s often times a little thankless. If she’s shaped you to be a kindhearted, determined individual, she did a wonderful job and deserves to be rewarded with something special.
Now, here’s where things get tricky. Sure, many of us are lucky enough to live a short commute away from our moms, but these days, it’s pretty common to be long-distance. If you’re not able to drive over and celebrate directly with your mom, perhaps a fun Mother’s Day food quote (accompanying some homemade cookies, or strawberries dipped in chocolate you mailed her, because she deserves it) you can text her may do the trick.h into parents.
