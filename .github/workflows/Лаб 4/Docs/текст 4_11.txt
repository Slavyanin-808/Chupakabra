It is important for every living creature to have food and drink. In the morning, we usually have breakfast, around the noon we have lunch, and in the evening we have dinner. Sometimes we eat at home, and sometimes we go to a restaurant or cafe. Many people can cook delicious food by themselves.
Our food consists of fruits, vegetables, cereals, meat and fish. We also eat dairy. Cooks can prepare different dishes from these products. They use recipes. Different nationalities have their own cuisine.
Some people today don’t eat meat and fish, they are called vegetarians. Some people often watch their diet to lose weight or to be healthy. Then they don’t eat food with sugar, flour and fat.
What do we usually drink? It is known that every person should drink plenty of water — about 2 litres a day. But we also drink other beverages like tea, coffee, milk, juice, wine, and lemonade.
